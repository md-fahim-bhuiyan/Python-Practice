In Python, list, tuple, and set are three common collection data types, each with their own unique characteristics. Here are the key differences between them:

List:
    Lists are defined with square brackets [].
    Lists are mutable, which means you can change their contents after they are created.
    Lists are ordered, which means the elements have a specific order and you can access them by their index.
    Lists can contain duplicate elements.
    Examples: my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana"]


Tuple:
    Tuples are defined with parentheses ().
    Tuples are immutable, which means you cannot change their contents after they are created.
    Tuples are ordered, which means the elements have a specific order and you can access them by their index.
    Tuples can contain duplicate elements.
    Examples: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana")


Set:
    Sets are defined with curly braces {} or the set() function.
    Sets are mutable, which means you can change their contents after they are created.
    Sets are unordered, which means the elements do not have a specific order and you cannot access them by their index.
    Sets cannot contain duplicate elements.
    Examples: my_set = {1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana"} or my_set = set([1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana"])
